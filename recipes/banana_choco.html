    <p>
      When you want a warm drink but hot chocolate is not doing the trick, this
      is the smoothie to make! We suggest you make it thick, pour it in a bowl,
      and top it with some granola and cacao nibs to have as your breakfast on
      those colder mornings! It makes for a balanced and healthy meal to start
      your day! And it feels like youâ€™re eating dessert for breakfast!

      Although this <b>Choconana</b> may seem to just be dirty desert, it's
      actually packed, I tell you PACKED with the goodness that you were looking
      for on those cold mornings
